# Login-Authentication
JWT-based authentication is a widely used method for securing web applications. It involves issuing a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login, which is then used for subsequent requests to verify the user's identity.


How JWT Authentication Works:
- User Login: The user provides credentials (username/password).
- Token Generation: If authentication is successful, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
- Token Storage: The client stores the JWT (usually in local storage or cookies).
- Token Usage: For each request, the client includes the JWT in the authorization header.
- Token Verification: The server validates the JWT and grants access if it's valid.
